Benefits of using RSVME software:
- Allows interactive planning of events between users
- Organized presentation of personal events and upcoming events of interest
- Information such as location of event or names of attendees is kept private from harmful users
- Webpage is easy to use and understand

When designing any software, it is important that the design process is ethically and morally sound. It is
important for users to feel safe and know that their privacy is ensured while using RSVME. While the above benefits
are a large part of our software, some ethical issues that may arise from using RSVME include information in our database containing user email addresses and passwords
getting hacked and potentially storing too much information about a user's schedule and where they will be. Furthermore,
the location of an event could present a safety issue if unwanted attendees are able to access the location. Users
may not want certain people viewing where they will be and at what times. Certain events, such as religious gatherings
or cultural festivals could be targets for hate crimes. It is our responsibility as software developers to ensure
none of these concerns apply to our users. It is important that countermeasures are taken to ensure that any
safety issues posed related to RSVME are addressed before users access the software.

The following include ways that these security issues could be resolved:
- Allow users to mute other users so that they do not receive a ping from this muted user
- Create a limit on the amount of rating a user can perform on a certain event.
This will prevent them from mass downvoting an event, which would arbitrarily inflate the negative
review on said event.
- Allow users to block other users from viewing their posts so users that have not been dealt with
right away by moderators cannot view potentially sensitive information about the whereabouts of a
user from their posts.
- Add a feature that allows users to report another user for inappropriate or offensive behavior
- Develop an admin panel where reports can be viewed by moderators and dealt with accordingly.
- Ensure users have to sign in more than once to view items meant for them
- Ensure that only shared users can view items meant for them
- Share location of event only if sign up is approved by event creator
- Users can only see others attending an event if they are approved to attend by event creator
